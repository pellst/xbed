def: "A type of evidence in which at least two distinct types of evidence have been integrated." [ECO:MCC, ECO:RCT]
comment: A key aspect of this type of evidence is that two or more pieces of information are combined to generate an emergent type of evidence not possible with the constituent pieces of evidence alone. A combinatorial analysis typically involves incorporation of different types of evidence.

def: "A type of evidence where an assertion is derived from another assertion via logical inference or some non-logical but rational means." [ECO:MCC]
comment: Inference is the process of deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true, or alternatively, arriving at conclusions via some non-logical means of observation of patterns of facts, which can result in identifying new meanings and contexts for understanding. Given the evidence provided by a set of premises, deductive reasoning involves drawing conclusions that necessarily follow, i.e. are certain, whereas inductive reasoning generates conclusions that are likely to be, but are not necessarily, true.
